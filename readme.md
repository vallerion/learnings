# Learnings

Here I document and take notes of something valuable for me from books, articles and courses.

## Taking notes process

Notes are things that resonate with my personal knowledge and experience, so they are very subjective.

### From articles

For articles, it is important to read it at least twice. First time to get a general idea and make some notes. Second to
pay more attention to details.

It's okay if several days, weeks or months (up to 3 months) have passed between the first and second readings.

### From books

Take notes on the first reading, back to them then chapter is finished. Do some research on notes, watch video or read
articles. Take notes on articles.
