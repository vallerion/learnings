# Learnings

Here I document and take notes of something valuable for me from books, articles and courses.

## Taking notes process

Notes are things that resonate with my personal knowledge and experience, so they are very subjective.

For taking notes you can use browser for articles and apple books highlight tool for books and papers.

Use different highlights color for interesting things, confusing and something requires additional research.

### From articles

For articles, it is important to read it at least twice. First time to get a general idea and make some notes. Avoid
diving into details at this step. Second pass to pay more attention to details and get good topic understanding.

It's okay if several days, weeks or months (up to 3 months) have passed between the first and second readings.

### From books

Take notes on the first reading, back to them then chapter is finished. Do some research on notes, watch video or read
articles. Take notes on articles.
